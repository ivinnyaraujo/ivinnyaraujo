# Ivy Araujo üó∫Ô∏è 

**`GIS & Data Solution Engineer`**



I'm a GIS professional passionate about creating digital solutions using geospatial science and technology, analytics, data engineering, and automation. Proficient in the Esri ArcGIS Stack, FME Form/Flow, and database technology (SQL Server/Azure), I have extensive experience across water utilities, asset management, geosciences, mapping, environmental science, and academic research.

I excel at understanding user needs to create tailored spatial and data solutions that enhance internal processes, foster innovation, and add value to projects and customers through location intelligence. Leading GIS and data projects with agile methodologies, I also provide technical support, maintain GIS infrastructure, and produce comprehensive project documentation. I enjoy creating content, sharing knowledge, and staying updated with the latest geospatial advancements.
